Verilog-based pixel shader with timing and CDC constraints
# Pixel Shader ‚Äì Verilog FPGA Design with CDC and Timing Constraints

This project implements a **Pixel Shader** module in Verilog that performs **color inversion** on RGB pixel inputs using handshake-based pipelining. It focuses not only on RTL design but also on **real-world FPGA implementation challenges**, particularly around **Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)** and **timing constraints**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Overview

This pixel shader inverts RGB values and uses pipelined handshaking. It is extended to handle clock domain crossing from an asynchronous domain (`clk_in`) to the main clock domain (`clk`) using 2-stage synchronizers.

```verilog
// Example inversion logic
pipe_r1 <= ~pixel_in_r;
pipe_g1 <= ~pixel_in_g;
pipe_b1 <= ~pixel_in_b;
```

## üß™ Simulation Instructions

To simulate:

1. Compile and simulate using your Verilog tool:
   ```sh
   vlog pixel_shader.v tb_pixel_shader.v
   vsim tb_pixel_shader
   ```
2. Observe the waveform:
   - Check for correct inversion
   - Verify timing and valid signal delays
   - Confirm no glitches during CDC
